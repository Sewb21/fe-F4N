# F4N Favour 4 a Neighbour Backend Project

**Introduction**

F4N is a mobile application that is designed to make it easy for communities to help each other with tasks, whilst also raising money for charity.

All users of the app have a specific charity registered to their account.

A user who requires assistance with a job will write a post to a jobs page which will include a description of the job, location, skills required and a picture, if necessary. When posting a job, a user should also pledge an amount that they will donate to the chosen charity of whoever they choose to do the job for them.

Other users can then post comments underneath the job, expressing their willingness to help and can also press a button which alerts the job-poster. The person who posted the job will then receive a notification of offers of help and can then select whoever they want to help.

The project has been built using the following:

- React Native: an open-source mobile application framework
- Expo: an open-source platform for making universal native apps
- Firebase: Google's mobile platform used for authentication and image storage
- Axios: a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
